### Hi!

I'm Lily! In my free time I work on software to make my life, and the lives of others, easier in some way. My pronouns are she/her/hers.

You can find articles, usually about tech stuff, [here on my site](https://lily.fyi/).

Currently my areas of focus are on toy languages and their implementation, as well as web applications and how to efficiently write them in Rust, my language of choice.

You can reach me:
